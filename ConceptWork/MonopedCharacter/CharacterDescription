This manta ray is a character that is very chill and go with the flow. The reason for this decision is to try to replicate the beauty and seamlessness that the manta ray has while gliding through the water in the character's personality.
I wanted to have a very streamlined design for this character, where the different elements flowed into and off of one another.
The most obvious feature of a manta ray is it's mouth, so I decided to have it's expressions, especiallly it's mouth be at the forefront of the character, while the rest of the body gets smaller and less obvious as you get closer to the tail.
I was referencing the giant oceanic manta ray specifically and wanted the unique markings of black and white to be present on this character design, as I thought it added an interesting visual element.
I think the face of the manta ray adds to the potential for a lot of expresiveness in the character because the facial features are so present. 
The wings were changed from the original animal to be less wavy and more uniform in motion, for ease of use in rigging and animating.
I thought this would be better overall in having a more fluid motion to the entirety of the character, and would have the wings help with this, rather than fight against it.
Overall, I hope to depict a fluid and relaxed character with this design as I think manta rays tend to be.
